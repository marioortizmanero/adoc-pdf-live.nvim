= adoc-pdf-live.nvim

Very simple live preview plugin for asciidoctor-pdf. HTML live preview is
perfect with the
https://asciidoctor.cn/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/[browser
plugins], but for PDF documents there's nothing available.

This is a plugin I made for my own use, so I've only tested it on
https://github.com/neovim/neovim[neovim nightly 0.5]. Feel free to open an issue
or pull request to fix anything on your system. This is my first vim plugin ever
as well, so there's probably lots to improve.
